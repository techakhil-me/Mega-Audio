## What it does

It is a website created to promote our new headphones that are comfortable and of high quality to enrich your listening experience.

## How we built it

We built this website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Challenges we ran into

There were many challenges which came up during the creation phase, designing was the main part of it. Constructing the layout, implementation and designing various parts like navbar, animating it was quite complicated. The most challenging part was the flicker animation and adjusting the 3-D Images.

## What's next for Mega Audio

We'll enhance and upgrade the user interface and try to implement a more sophisticated design to enhance the overall user experience.
